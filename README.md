# web-development
This a repository for my **web-development** projects. 
I am not very keen about webdev, but I find it quite interesting as a hobby.

This is a list of things I have done so far:
1) Portfolio Website
    * Having a portfolio is important. 

**Sidenote**

Today's web applications have become so dynamic that they basically may push 
all software to the web rather than phone and computer applications.
Why installing software when you can just open a browser and have it? 
If things like AWS and Azure will keep pushing hardware access for low prices,
cloud computing will become universal, and this is where webdev is a key.
